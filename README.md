3. How I built this website
The website is made by using PHP with OOP technique.  OOP technique is used in admin dashboard showing items in database and user tables, in adding items, deleting item, updating items, displaying items, searching items and sorting items. Admin can add, update and delete items. Uploading of images are also facilitated. This website also facilitates a dynamic PDF representation of table showing user details in admin dashboard. It also has server side validation in login/registration with captcha to prevent bots. A user can search or sort items accordingly. If a user has any problem he/she can contact the admin in Contact Us. If a user contacts by filling his/her form a reply mail is immediately sent providing him with a copy of his message. User can also edit their profile after they are logged in.
